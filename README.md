🌍 Carbon Footprint Tracker (Java Swing)
A desktop application built using Java Swing that helps users track, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint based on their daily activities such as transportation, energy usage, and diet choices.

🚀 Features
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple, interactive GUI built with Java Swing
✅ Activity Logging – Enter daily habits like travel distance, electricity use, and food consumption
✅ Carbon Calculation Engine – Estimates total CO₂ emissions based on standardized emission factors
✅ Visualization – Displays results via progress bars or charts for better understanding
✅ History Tracking – Keeps records of previous days to monitor your footprint over time
✅ Tips for Sustainability – Suggests ways to reduce carbon impact

🧠 How It Works
Input Activities
Users fill in forms for daily energy usage, transportation mode, and diet habits.
Emission Calculation
The backend logic calculates the total CO₂ equivalent based on user input using predefined emission factors.
Visualization & Feedback
The app displays your total emissions and gives actionable advice to reduce it.

🧮 Example Calculation
For example,
Driving a petrol car for 10 km emits approximately 2.4 kg of CO₂.
Eating a vegetarian meal emits 0.5 kg CO₂, while a non-vegetarian meal emits 1.7 kg CO₂.
The app aggregates these across all activities to show your daily footprint.
